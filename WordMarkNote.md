## My WordMark Note

WordMark is a single-pane WYSIWYG realtime previewing Markdown editor. You edit directly in the rendered text.

**Note** that you have to move the mouse to the left hand edge to summon a pane.

Questions:
1. Can we import or export Markdown? Yes, mouse left and use the <u>menus</u> there.
2. Where does MarkText keep our notes? Where we save them.

Notes;

1. WordMark does not understand tables. Not very well.
2. HTML codes don't work. &pi; does not convert to $\pi$
3. f(x)=a~0~ 

Tables not looking too good:

| Heading | Another |
| ---------:  | :---------: || Cell       |  Cell        |  
| An item | Another one |


`Above us is a table`.
